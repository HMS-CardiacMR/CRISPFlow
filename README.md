    Velocity compensated and encoded images acquired with low resolution are reconstructed using the vendor reconstruction algorithm pipeline. The low-resolution images are sent to an external sever via a Framework for Image Reconstruction (FIRE) interface. Network 1 is used to enhance complex-difference images, which are obtained using complex-valued subtraction of velocity compensated and encoded images. Network 2 enhances velocity compensated images directly. Both networks enhance real and imaginary parts separately. The resolution-enhanced velocity compensated and encoded images, the latter obtained through complex-valued addition, are returned to the vendor pipeline to reconstruct anatomical and phase-contrast images.
